Create a calculator app in angular electron. Make sure there is tight and safe IPC. Add a dialog for settings such as the accent color, store these using a nodejs api call. Document the electron security you've done in detail in SECURITY.md. Make it so this project can be installed for macos using squirrel. Make preperations for windows installer too. There must be 2 calculator pages, one normal, one scientific. First create a full plan of action, follow this plan. Whenever you find the plan subobtimal when actually implementing, you're allowed to deviate.
